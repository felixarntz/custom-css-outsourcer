Loads the additional Customizer CSS from external files instead of printing it directly to the page.

== Description ==

This tiny plugin modifies the new Custom CSS functionality introduced in WordPress 4.7.

By default, any additional CSS written in the Customizer is printed directly to the head of the page. The plugin changes it to load the CSS from a somewhat virtual file, using a custom rewrite rule, which can make sense to clean up your HTML code. The contents of the stylesheet will be cached.
